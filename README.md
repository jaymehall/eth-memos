# ETH Memos

## Description
This is a basic CRUD application designed to be used on desktop only to allow users to simply create, read, update, and delete memos. It is built with a React frontend framework and a MongoDB, Express Server, and Node.js backend. This project originated as a coding-challenge for a company called Nuance, a decentralized blog-posting Dapp built on the ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) blockchain. I intend to refactor this application in the future to utilize either Motoko or Solidity in the backend so that users can store their memos with the peace of mind and security that comes with having data stored on the blockchain.
